                  <p>Project 06.01.01 is my semestre exam project, this is what i am the most proud of as this is the website I've spent most time on making ever. This website is the conclusion of everything I've learnt this semestre.</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>Making this website i started sketching and making different ideas as to what a usual portfolio site is. I found out it is a presentation of your self and is a sort of "this is me" website.</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>I found some different colors i wanted to use and wanted to reflect my favorite colors aswell as my favorite time of the year, summer. This led me to use light, warm, soft colors</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>I wanted to use the strongest contrast of colors, Yellow and Purple. To show my new knowledge in colors and design i chose to use these two colors as they are opposite on the color wheel</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>I chose to make my button hovers and text the same nuance as the purple color to make the site more manageable and better to look at, because my background color is a strong contrast</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>I also chose to use rounded edges in all my CSS to make it more pleasant and less sharp for the eyes.</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>This project is also where i have ever learnt the most JavaScript as i chose to use my vacation in december to learn as much JavaScript as possible since i had a few struggles last time i used it.</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>This resulted in me using JavaScript for my menu button and all the sites showing up, as there is only one single HTML file in the website. I decided to make different section tags and then use JavaScript to toggle/fade all the sections whenever you click around the site.</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>The font used is from Google, and the icons used on my Contact page is used from Font-Awesome, which designs logos and icons for websites, as they will always have the same size as the text.</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>Overall i am very proud of this site as I've used this project to re-learn most JavaScript using YouTube and W3school and build further on my knowledge in HTML and CSS.</p>

                  <p>The purpose of Project 05.02.01 was to create and redesign a website of another existing brand of our own choice. The redesign must have a coded website and have content such as text, photos and videos. For this we decided to create a website prototype in Adobe Xd.</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>We also made the video using a drone to get shots of the forests, and we also made a promotional video with an external microphone and a DSLR camera.</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>I learned much about video editing, also some things that i did not know about beforehand. Here i learned about montage clipping, standard VFX in premiere pro and how to split sound files from the video to make slow-motion.</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>I also learned the importance of working on prototypes before coding. My role here was to make research on the lumberjack market and scout other websites so that we could make a unique website.</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>With my new knowledge of videoediting and research i was able to help my team make our website for the business "Top Trælfældning ApS"</p>

                  <p>For project 05.01.02 i was assigned to make a website and video of someone with a passion for anything. Here i chose to interview my good friend Marvin as he has a huge passion for the videogame called Counter Strike - Global Offensive</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>Here i learned about B-rolls where the protagonist of the video usally does something meaningful for the purpose of the video.</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>This was also the first website i made where i chose to experiment more with CSS to make more layers, use of background and format more differently on the pictures. I also learned how to implement videos, YouTube and MP4.</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>Learning all this i became more confident in my coding, especially in CSS.</p>

                  <p>In Project 04.04.01 i got to learn JavaScript for the first time ever. My assignment was to create a simple and basic videogame using JavaScript with the only two limitations being:</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>Two elements can not react to eachother</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>No more than 10 things to click on</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>For this i started drawing and making prototypes of a videogame with cars moving from the left to right. I learned the importance of drawing my ideas and prototyping before coding.</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>When i started coding i also started learning JavaScript for the first time. I also learned how to use Adobe Illustrator for the first time as i had to make pixel art for this. Illustrator is an interesting tool as almost anything is possible regarding graphic design inside the tool.</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>When i had all my assets ready and most of my coding on point the game started to look like a real game.</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>I learned a lot in JavaScript, especially how to make items move and react when clicking ex. "EventListener", "Add/Remove". I think it is a good language to learn as i have found out it can be the fundamental language for most websites and makes me excited for using JavaScript even more.</p>

                  <p>Project 03.03.02 was the pitch presentation for my Tree Tees prototype website.</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>Here i created a powerpoint to demonstrate and show my prototype and to pitch it infront of some other students and my teacher.</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>In the pitch i covered my UX-research as observations, interviews and general research</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>I also covered my EX and UI design, ex. my website is made around the ethic patos. The pictures are simplistic and i talked about my Unique Selling Point (USP).</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>At last i talked about my UX-tests and came to the comclusion that my prototype scaling was too big, however it was easy to navigate in and that the idea has tons of opportunities.</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>What i learned from pitching is that beside having to sell the product during a pitch, i can also learn so much from the people hearing the pitch as they also come with ideas or problem solving to some parts.</p>

                  <p>For Project 03.03.02 i had tp create a prototype website, but without the coding part. I started out making a simple prototype in Adobe Xd which will progress into a better prototype with focus on Interaction, Photostyle and Copy.</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>I started making the first prototype in Adobe Xd which i made out of a hand drawed sketch. I spent some time getting UI kits so that others would understand my first prototype more easily.</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>I then continued on making moodboards and styletiles. With these two i also started on Copy and Microcopy which essentially is finding inspiration and researching related websites on the same brand/idea.</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>At last, i found inspiration for my style of photos, for this i went on different websites to find pictures related to the theme my website was about. I edited some aswell in Adobe Photoshop and implemented them to my moodboard.</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>With all the above done, i started making my new prototype in Adobe Xd, which also led to being the final prototype about sustainable fashion using trees as fabric. I learned so much about prototyping and how important it can be to build further on the first idea with ex. Moodboard or Copy</p>

                  <p>Project 02.02.01 was my first major project where i could do whatever i wanted with a website. Here i had to make a website with my own chosen theme, i had to take use of moodboards and wireframes to plan the website structure.</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>I had to use HTML and CSS freely and make it responsive, the only limitation was it could not be more than 2-6 pages.</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>I immediately started coding and chose to make a tourist/blog site where people could see recommendations on food, drinks and places to go in the summer in Denmark</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>I was satisfied with the idea, however i felt troubled with the design part as i was still new. However i got to use layout/grid, typography, textlayout, picture style, color correcting and contrasts.</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>The colors i chose to use were simple, white background with summer and earth colors to give it a summer feel.</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>As this was the first time i freely made a website with the use of HTML and CSS, i think i learned much from CSS ex. padding, margin and colors. This was also were i really learned about the @media tag for making a website responsive.</p>

                  <p>The first website i ever made was Project 02.01.01.</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>Here i was assigned a wireframe and a layoutdiagram, so that i could see how to site had to look like and what tags/id i had to use. I also recieved the pictures and some of the text that had to be used for this, which means the only thing i had to learn was HTML and CSS.</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>This was also the first time i got to use CSS on a website.</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>It is a very simple website with almost no formatting on the website, however this is where i started to learn about HTML and CSS.</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>Beside HTML and CSS i also learned how to implement fonts using google fonts and adobe fonts.</p>
